## How to use

All code available for R, Stata and Python. To see options for various languages, check out:

## Status

The [Latest release, 0.9.0 "Frank Exchange of Views"](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da_case_studies/releases/tag/v0.9.0) was released 14 August 2025. 

Overall, the transition to `seaborn` and `pyfixest` drove most of the **Python**‑side evolution, while the **R** side adopted `fixest`/`marginaleffects`. **Stata** materials remained largely stable, reflecting a focus on modernizing the Python and R components for reproducibility and ease of use. No Julia yet. See detailes in the changelog / release notes. 

## Organization
1. Each case study has a separate folder.
2. Within case study folders, codes in different languages are simply stored together. 
3. Data should be downloaded and stored in a separate folder. 

## Code language versions
1. **R** -- We used R 4.0.2. 
2. **Stata** -- We used version 15, allmost all code should work in version 13 up.
3. **Python** -- We used Python 3.12.0.

## Get data
Data is hosted on OSF.io

## Found an error or have a suggestion?
Awesome, we know there are errors and bugs. Or just much better ways to do a procedure.

To make a suggestion, please open a `github issue` here with a title containing the case study name. You may also contact [us directctly](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/contact-us/). Cheers!
