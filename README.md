## How to use
On the [textbook's website]((https://gabors-data-analysis.com/)), we have detailed discussion of how to set up libraries, get data and code: [Overview of data and code](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/data-and-code/)

To see options for various languages, check out:
1. **R** --  [How to run code in R ](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/howto-r/)
2. **Stata** -- [How to run code in Stata ](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/howto-stata/)

## Status (25 November, 2022)

The [Latest release, 0.8.3 "Ethics Gradient"](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da_case_studies/releases/tag/v0.8.3) was released on 25 November. 

In the latest release we did some refactoring re Python and R codes. We continuously monitor bugs and do regular, if mostly minor updates. 

## Organization
1. Each case study has a separate folder.
2. Within case study folders, codes in different languages are simply stored together. 
3. Data should be downloaded and stored in a separate folder. 

## Code language versions
1. **R** -- We used R 4.0.2. 
2. **Stata** -- We used version 15, allmost all code should work in version 13 up.
3. **Python** -- We used Python 3.12.0.

## Get data
Data is hosted on OSF.io

## Found an error or have a suggestion?
Awesome, we know there are errors and bugs. Or just much better ways to do a procedure.

To make a suggestion, please open a `github issue` here with a title containing the case study name. You may also contact [us directctly](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/contact-us/). Cheers!
