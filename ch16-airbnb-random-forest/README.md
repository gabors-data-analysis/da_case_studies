# Information about *_shap* versions 


For this chapter we added additional code versions including preliminary analysis with [TreeSHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). These are not part of the 1st edition of the textbook, but might be in the second edition. 

They are in development, comments and suggestions (as issues) are welcome.
