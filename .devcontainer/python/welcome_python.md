# Welcome to Python in GitHub Codespaces!

## How to start?

1. Download the data repository from OSF if you plan to use this Codespace in the long run. This is not mandatory, as the you can also download the individual files in each code by uncommenting the relevant lines.
    - To do so, open a terminal (hit `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+C` or use the sidebar's Terminal > New Terminal option). Paste the following command and hit Enter: `bash .devcontainer/scripts/download-data.sh`
    - This will automatically download, extract and place in the right folder structure all the data files that are needed to run the scripts.
2. Open any Jupyter notebook you want to run. Click the *Select kernel* button in the top right corner.
3. Select the pre-configured `daenv` Python environment.
4. Enjoy.

*Note: This is a Python-only environment! To run R codes, you have to set up a Codespace configured with an R environment. To do so, follow the README of the repository on GitHub.*
