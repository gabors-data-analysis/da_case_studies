# Welcome to R in GitHub Codespaces!

## How to start?

1. Download the data repository from OSF if you plan to use this Codespace in the long run. This is not mandatory, as the you can also download the individual files in each code by uncommenting the relevant lines.
    - To do so, open a terminal (hit `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+C` or use the sidebar's Terminal > New Terminal option). Paste the following command and hit Enter: `bash .devcontainer/scripts/download-data.sh`
    - This will automatically download, extract and place in the right folder structure all the data files that are needed to run the scripts.
2. Start an interactive R terminal.
    - To do so, press `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P` to open up the VSCode command palette. Search for *R: Create R Terminal* and click on the command. A new R terminal will be started for you.
3. Open any R code you want to run. You can the line where your cursor is at or the currently selected codechunk by pressing `Ctrl/Cmd+Enter`
4. Enjoy.

*Note: This is an R-only environment! To run Python codes, you have to set up a Codespace configured with a Python environment. To do so, follow the README of the repository on GitHub.*
